# Puppy Helper

## Description
Puppy-Helper is an app that is designed to help raise your new puppy! I found that with babies you could find a lot of applications to help you track almost anything. But this was not the case for puppies and I wanted to change that. With Puppy-Helper you are able to add multiple dogs and track their trick progress, napping times, food usage, vet visits, medicine and potty tracking.

React Filebase64 for showing me how to handle image files to base64. Modified the code to allow more props to limit errors.
